        <p>The successor array notation is a googological notation that I created. Similar to most array notations, it allows reducing an expression made up of several
            numbers into a single extremely large number. This notation is divided into the following parts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><a href="./linear-array-notation.html">Linear array notation</a></li>
            <li><a href="./dimensional-array-notation.html">Dimensional array notation</a></li>
            <li><a href="./nested-array-notation.html">Nested array notation</a></li>
        </ol>
        <p>I called this array notation the "successor array notation" because it is based on the successor function. It was originally provisionally named "stronger array notation" when I had as the eventual goal for this notation was to be stronger than Hyp cos's strong array notation, but the name was later changed to successor array notation.
           This notation is similar to typical array notations, especially to Phenol notation, up to nested array notation, but after nested array notation it takes its own turn.
