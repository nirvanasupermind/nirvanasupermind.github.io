            X is an sequence of arbitrary non-negative integers (any separators can be between them)
            Y is an sequence of only 0 (any separators can be between them)
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>a{} = a + 1</li>
            <li>a{@(n)0} = a{@} (remove trailing zeros)</li>
            <li>a{b(n)@} = a{b - 1(n)@}{b - 1(n)@} if b > 0</li>            
        </ol>
        <p>If none of the rules apply, start this process starting from the first entry inside the curly brackets:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the entry is equal to 0, jump to the next entry.</li>
            <li>If the entry is greater than 0, there must be a 0 preceding it.
                <ol>
                    <li>If there is a comma between the 0 and the nonzero entry, replace the "0, b" with "a, b - 1" where a is the base and b is the nonzero entry. In simpler terms: a{0,0...,0,0,b,@} = a{0,0...,0,a,b-1,@} if b > 0. The process ends.</li>
                    <li>If there is a non-comma separator (n(m)@) where n > 0 between the 0 and the nonzero entry, replace the "0(n@)b" with "a(n - 1@)a(n - 1@)...a(n - 1@)a(n@)b-1" with b copies of a before the (n@), where a is the base and b is the nonzero entry. The process ends.</li>
                    <li>If there is a non-comma separator (0(m)@) between the 0 and the nonzero entry, simplify the separator itself, applying theq rule 2 of this notation to remove trailing zeros and/or this processt. </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The application of the rules and/or process should be repeated until the expression is reduced to a number.</p>
