        <p>The double array notation is a notation which allows reducing an expression made up of several
            numbers into a single extremely large number, for the purpose of googology. Define an array as any
            (possibly empty) list of non-negative integers (entries) separated by separators. A separator can be any two arrays separated by a semicolon and wrapped in round braces, like (1,2,3;4;5;6). The comma may be used a shorthand for the separator () or (0). "0;" is optional and can be omitted.

            Let @ and # denote arbitrary arrays and let $ denote an arbitrary separator. A valid expression is of the form a{@}, where a can be any non-negative integer and is referred to as the

            In order to evaluate an expression into a number, the following rules should be used:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>a{} = a + 1</li>
            <li>a{@$0} = a{@} (remove trailing zeros)</li>
            <li>a{b$@} = a{b - 1$@}{b - 1$@} if b > 0</li>
        </ol>
        <p>If none of the rules apply, start this process starting from the first entry inside the curly brackets:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>If the entry is equal to 0, jump to the next entry.</li>
            <li>If the entry is greater than 0, there must be a 0 preceding it.
                <ol>
                    <li>If there is a comma between the 0 and the nonzero entry, replace the "0, b" with "a, b - 1" where a is the base and b is the nonzero entry. In simpler terms: a{0,0...,0,0,b,@} = a{0,0...,0,a,b-1,@} if b > 0. The process ends.</li>
                    <li>If there is a non-comma separator (@;n$#) where n > 0 between the 0 and the nonzero entry, replace the "0(@;n$#)b" with "a(@;n - 1$#)a(@;n - 1$#)...a(@;n - 1$#)a(@;n - 1$#)b-1" with b copies of a before the (n$@), where a is the base and b is the nonzero entry. The process ends.</li>
                    <li>If there is a non-comma separator (@;0$#) between the 0 and the nonzero entry, simplify the separator itself, removing trailing zeros (analogous to rule 2 of the notation) and/or applying this process on the numbers inside the separator until the separator cannot be simplified anymore. The process ends.</li>
                    <li>If there is a separator (n$@;) where n > 0 between the 0 and the nonzero entry, replace the "0(n$@;)b" with s<sub>b</sub> where s<sub>0</sub> = b and s<sub>k</sub> = a(n - 1$@;s<sub>k - 1</sub>)a. The process ends.</li>
                    <li>If there is a separator (0$@;) between the 0 and the nonzero entry, simplify the separator itself, removing trailing zeros (analogous to rule 2 of the notation) and/or applying this process on the numbers inside the separator until the separator cannot be simplified anymore. The process ends.</li>
                    </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The application of the rules and/or process should be repeated until the expression is reduced to a number.</p>
        <h1>Comparison to fast-growing hierarchy</h1>
        <p>The limit of this notation is around (idk right now) in the FGH with the Wainer hierarchy as the system of fundamental sequences. Below I will give the comparison of this notation to the fast-growing hierarchy with the Wainer hierarchy as the system of fundamental sequences:</p>

            a{0(1;)1} ≈ f<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub>(a)
            a{1(1;)1} ≈ f<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>2</sup>(a)
            a{2(1;)1} ≈ f<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>4</sup>(a)
            a{3(1;)1} ≈ f<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>8</sup>(a)
            a{4(1;)1} ≈ f<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub></sub><sup>16</sup>(a)
            a{0,1(1;)1} ≈ f<sub>&epsilon;<sub>0</sub>+1</sub>(a)
